# Hello World on KICKS

The goal here is to create a step by step document for getting a "Hello 
World" program up and running. The KICKS and Tur(n)key documentation is 
outstanding, but it ends up being a bit fragmented if you're trying to go 
soup to nuts with "Hello World".

### Install Hercules and the Tur(n)key System TK5

I won't go into depth on how to get Hercules and TK up and running. 
There are great written resources here:

I'll note a YouTube channel that I absolutely love: https://www.youtube.com/@moshixmainframechannel

Moshix puts out great stuff and this channel has been essential during my 
education on MVS based stuff.  His video specifically on installing Hercules 
on Windows is here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTxe8ASdxE0


### Install KICKS

I also won't go into depth on this.  However Moshix's video on installing 
KICKS was all I needed to get going.  I just followed along and everything 
worked perfectly: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_ZSH9OagTM
